Personal project
## Concept
A local bakery in my neighbourhood had an outdated and uninformative website that includes inaccurate prices and few images.

As a personal challenge I decided to built an alternative website, showcasing their variety of products.

*This is a personal project to practice CSS grid, and was not intended to rival their real website, therefore the name was changed and the images were taken from Upsplash. Maybe some day I'll have a chance to approach them with a suggestion to build the real one* :wink:
